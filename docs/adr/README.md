# Architectural Decision Records

Record all major decisions taken throughout the lifecycle of the project by using Lightweight Architectural Decision Records [ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record). 

This will help newcomers to step through the thought processes and answer questions about why things are done in a certain way

They should be in the following format:

# 1. Short Name
Date: Today's date in backwards American format e.g. 17-08-2018

## Status
Accepted or Pending

## Context
The context and background surrounding this decision. Why we had to make it.

## Decision
The final choice made. Include alternatives which may have been considered here.

## Consequences
What are the consequences of the decision how will this affect future design decisions?
