# How to Contribute

All contributions are welcome.

## 1. Coding Standards

* All code must be formatted with the `Gofmt` tool and follow standard community conventions
* Add test coverage where possible. Commits which reduce coverage where avoidable, will be rejected
* Write code to be testable. Code which is testable is generally better written and more reusable
* Code should be written in a simple and elegant manner so it's purpose and function is obvious without documentation. Anything more opaque must be commented
* As an addendum to the above point; just comment it anyway!
* Include high level documentation in markdown format in the README
* Record all major decisions taken throughout the lifecycle of the project by using Lightweight Architectural Decision Records [ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record). This will help newcomers to step through the thought processes and answer questions about why things are done in a certain way
* Code should be performant and use no less resources than it needs to
* Applications should be trivial to deploy, maintain and operate

## 2. Bugs and Features

Please include as much detail as you can when submitting bugs and feature requests via [issues](https://github.com/skybet/go-skyremote/issues). Even better, have a go yourself and submit a pull request!
